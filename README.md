## Introduction
The 300 points will be earned as follows:

- 150 points will be earned from pre-selected problems, covering the basics (loop, conditional, data types, etc..)
- 150 points will be earned flexibly, allowing me to choose freely the problems to solve (different difficulties reward different points (2, 8, 32, & 128 for the most difficult levels).
